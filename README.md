# decisiontrees

There is an old folder in here from when I made a decision tree to classify mushrooms in my machine learning course in undergrad. I will use this as a starting point. I will also use my textbook from this course, which was called "Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach" by Stuart J Russell and Peter Norvig
