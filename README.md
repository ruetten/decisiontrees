# Decisiontrees

## main.py
This is where my the majority of my code for this assignment is located, including building the decision tree and answering most questions from section 2.

The main way to use this file is:
python3 main.py data/<filename>.txt

Where the command line argument is the data to build the tree on

## data
This folder is where I stored all my data from data.zip, as well as any data I produced from section 2 question 7 and any tests I wanted to create manually.

## output
This folder is where I outputted most of my output files when using matplotlib and stuff like that. Not all png files are here because I often just generated what I needed for my LaTeX document and overwrote what I had before when I needed to generate something new.

## section3_and_question7
This folder is where I stored the work from section 2 question 7 and section 3 with sklearn. I actually ran this code one level up within the decisiontrees folder, but I moved it in here before submission for organization's sake.

WARNING: This code was not written in mind with someone else using it and testing it and it being robust. I was just trying to produce results for the LaTeX questions.

## section4_lagrange
This folder is where I stored the work from section 4.

## old_java
There is an old folder in here from when I made a decision tree to classify mushrooms in my machine learning course in undergrad. I used this as a starting point. I will also used my textbook from this undergrad course, which was called "Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach" by Stuart J Russell and Peter Norvig. This textbook is incredible and really helped me understand decision trees at a deeper level beyond what we covered in lecture.
